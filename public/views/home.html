    This is a little project i made up in about a days time. i was really bored so i decided to submit this as my final. As you can see its a full blown media player. I built the server
    that this runs on from the ground up. From the auth to the code that handles playing and pausing songs <a onclick="songsView()">ðŸ˜ƒ</a>. You can upload songs or even see other songs that 
    people have uploaded and maybe even add them to your music library

<ul>
    <h1>Things that it can do</h1>

    <li>Upload your own songs</li>
